- **Model Architectures:** RNN, BRNN, LSTM, BLSTM, Neural Net, BERT

## How It Works

The chatbot's operation revolves around natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It analyzes user queries, understands context, and generates relevant responses. Here are the key features:

1. **Registration and Login:**
   - Users can register by providing their details.
